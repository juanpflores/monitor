#Projecto de Sistemas Operativos - Gunnar Wolf

## Synopsis

At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)

## Ejemplo de Código

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivación

La motivación del projecto es aplicar de manera práctica los conocimiento adquiridos en los temas de manejo de hilos, concurrencia y procesos. 

## Instalación
La instalacion del projecto es sencilla, solo es necesario conocer algunas comandos básicos de git y python para correr el programa. 
```
cd ubicacion-folder
mkdir tu-folder
git clone <link>
cd monitor
python monitor.py
```
## API 

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Pruebas

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
